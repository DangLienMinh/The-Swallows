The Swallows
============

_The Swallows_ is a series of computer-generated novels meta-written for
[NaNoGenMo 2013](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo) by
Cat's Eye Technologies.  Our submission issue can be found
[here](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/39).

_The Swallows_ is also the name of the first novel in the series.
It follows the madcap adventures of Alice and Bob as they both try
to acquire the golden falcon, which is priceless, or at the very least
[irrationably desirable by all involved](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin).

_The Swallows of Summer_, the sequel to _The Swallows_, revisits
Alice and Bob's life three years later.  They have a much bigger house
now.  They also own more things.

Both novels can be found, in Markdown format, in the `doc` subdirectory
of this distribution.

At 4.9K words (in 15 chapters of 33 paragraphs each,) _The Swallows_ is not
quite long enough to qualify for NaNoGenMo.  At 5.3K words,
_The Swallows of Summer_ is.

There is another sequel vaguely planned for future release, working title
_Swallows and Sorrows_, which is currently a work in progress.

All novels were generated by the script `the_swallows.py` in the
`script` directory, at different points in time.  See the repository
history to get the version of the script used for a particular novel.

The script is basically a text adventure game, except without a human
player â€” just a few NPCs, and the output is a report on their actions.
